                            *** TODO LIST ***
                            =================

### URGENT PRIORITY
* [x] Admit binary expression in variable assignments

### NORMAL PRIORITY
* [x] Fix char and string literals lexing
* [x] Expression vs statement, block vs compound statement
* [x] Function body is compound statement
* [ ] Amplify function calling
* [ ] Provide sense of scope
* [ ] Symbol types are values
* [ ] Array-based parser (bunch of nodes in dynamic arrays, indices as pointer to node). Profile gains
* [ ] rework reallocation. If there is enough space ahead of the allocated space, just modify block metadata (amplify allocation boundaries) and don't copy already existent data
* [ ] when doing standard library, redesign memcpy/memcmp so they are all safe and check size on ***BOTH*** ends
