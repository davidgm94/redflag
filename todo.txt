                            *** TODO LIST ***
                            =================

* Symbol types are values
* Array-based parser (bunch of nodes in dynamic arrays, indices as pointer to node)
* rework reallocation. If there is enough space ahead of the allocated space,
just modify block metadata (amplify allocation boundaries) and don't copy already existent data
* when doing standard library, redesign memcpy/memcmp so they are all safe and check size on ***BOTH*** ends
